# Budget App

## Introduction

I'm going to be honest: I'm bad with money. So, like many poor spenders my age, I turned to the plethora of budgeting apps on the App Store. And while I appreciate them being free-to-use and oft-beautiful UI's, I strongly disliked most of them.

Here's the thing about a budgeting app. Anyone who can manage their money well is already going to be doing the diligence that these apps expect from the user. I found myself mentally exhausted trying to categorize all of my purchases. Thus, my mantra for this little application came from the wise words of Micahel Scott: "K.I.S.S. (Keep It Simple Stupid)".

So, this is simple. It's going to take your income and make it just that: income. Doesn't care where it's from. That's your money, you earned it, congratulations.

The next step: dividing it into a mere three categories. Elizabeth Warren's 50/30/20 method divides money into needs, wants, and savings. And I think that's good enough for me, so I went with that. Peace of mind achieved. Add expenses whenever you want, in just two steps (the amount of money, and the value of said money).

This is mostly for me, because again, I suck with money. But this is a common issue, so I would not be opposed to anyone else using this!
